Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest to the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings on the ACL Anthology. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work and should clearly indicate the state of completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. Here is the link to the DMR submission site. Submissions must adhere to the two-column format of ACL venues: please use our specific style-files or the Overleaf template, taken from ACL 2021. Similar to ACL 2021, initial submissions should be fully anonymous to ensure double-blind reviewing. Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content. If a paper is accepted, it will be given an additional page to address reviewersâ€™ comments in the final version. References and appendices do not count against these limits.

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal any author's identity--e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." should be replaced with citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop organizers (dmr2023-chairs@googlegroups.com). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.

** DMR 2023 does not have an anonymity period. However, we ask you to be reasonable and not publicly advertise your preprint during (or right before) review. **
